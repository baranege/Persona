# Forecasting average return on new customers by persona

A game company wants to forecast average profit for new customers by observing 
some demographic information of their customers. To do so, the company wants to 
create level-based persona definitions and segment them by these definitions.


## Data
Persona.csv dataset includes prices of the products sold by a game company and 
demographic information of customers who bought these products.

Dataset is created through transactions by customers. Thus, it may include 
more than one transaction per customer.
